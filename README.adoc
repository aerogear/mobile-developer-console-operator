The Mobile Developer Console Operator for Kubernetes provides an easy way to
install and manage an AeroGear Mobile Developer Console Operator on Kubernetes.

toc::[]


== Limitations

// https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AEROGEAR-9162
[NOTE]
====
This operator currently only works on OpenShift. This is because it
provisions `Route`s and also relies on the fact that OpenShift
provides an OAuth server. In future we aim to make it work on vanilla
Kubernetes also.
====

== Cloning the repository

By the following commands you will create a local directory and clone this project.

[source,shell]
----
$ git clone git@github.com:aerogear/mobile-developer-console-operator.git $GOPATH/src/github.com/aerogear/mobile-developer-console-operator
----

== Minishift Pre-requisites

. Enable CORS addon on Minishift

Follow these {minishift_cors} in order to enable CORS on Minishift.

....
if minishift addons list | grep cors ; then
    minishift addons apply cors	
else	
    MINISHIFT_ADDONS_PATH=/tmp/minishift-addons	
    rm -rf $MINISHIFT_ADDONS_PATH && git clone https://github.com/minishift/minishift-addons.git $MINISHIFT_ADDONS_PATH	
    # Not needed after https://github.com/minishift/minishift-addons/pull/187 is merged	
    cd $MINISHIFT_ADDONS_PATH	
    git fetch origin pull/187/head:cors-fix && git checkout cors-fix	
    minishift addons install /tmp/minishift-addons/add-ons/cors	
    minishift addons apply cors	
fi	
....

. Export required OPENSHIFT_HOST variable
....
export OPENSHIFT_HOST=$(minishift ip):8443
....

== Installing the Operator

As a user with admin permissions, you can install the
mobile-developer-console-operator in your OpenShift cluster as follows:

....
make cluster/prepare

make install-operator

OPENSHIFT_HOST=https://your-openshift-host
# or OPENSHIFT_HOST=$(minishift ip):8443, as described in previous section

oc set env -n mobile-developer-console deployment/$(oc get -n mobile-developer-console -f deploy/operator.yaml --template "{{.metadata.name}}") OPENSHIFT_HOST="${OPENSHIFT_HOST}"
....

== Provisioning a Mobile Developer Console instance

....
make install-mdc
....

Once the `mobiledeveloperconsole` CR is created with the `make install-mdc` above, the operator will provision a Mobile Developer Console instance.

However, an OAuthClient needs to be created with the Mobile Developer Console URL.

....
OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=$(oc get -n mobile-developer-console -f deploy/crds/mdc_v1alpha1_mobiledeveloperconsole_cr.yaml --template "{{.spec.oAuthClientId}}")
OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=$(oc get -n mobile-developer-console -f deploy/crds/mdc_v1alpha1_mobiledeveloperconsole_cr.yaml --template "{{.spec.oAuthClientSecret}}")
MDC_ROUTE=$(oc -n mobile-developer-console get route example-mdc-mdc-proxy --template "{{.spec.host}}")

cat <<EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
grantMethod: auto
kind: OAuthClient
metadata:
  name: ${OAUTH_CLIENT_ID}
secret: ${OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET}
redirectURIs: ["https://${MDC_ROUTE}"]
EOF

oc rollout latest example-mdc
....

== Configuration

=== OpenShift Host

Although it is clear for the person managing/deploying the Mobile Developer Console operator, it is not clear for the
operator itself to get the public hostname of the OpenShift cluster. This hostname is required by the operator.
It will then be passed to provisioned Mobile Developer Console instances. Mobile Developer Console uses this public hostname
in its web UI to make calls to OpenShift REST API. Thus the value given in the environment variable must be public and accessible by potential users'
browsers. Instructions at the top of the document for enabling CORS in OpenShift is also because of the same reasons.

.Environment Variables
|===
|Name |Default |Purpose

|`OPENSHIFT_HOST`
| None - it is required
| Public hostname of the OpenShift cluster

|===

=== Image Streams

The operator uses 2 image streams and what image streams to use are configurable
with environment variables.

Mobile Developer Console and OAuth proxy image stream are created within the same namespace by the operator.

The following table shows the available environment variable names, along with their default values:

.Environment Variables
|===
|Name |Default |Purpose

|`MDC_IMAGE_STREAM_NAME`
|`mdc-imagestream`
| Name of the Mobile Developer Console image stream that will be created by the operator.

|`MDC_IMAGE_STREAM_TAG`
|`latest`
| Tag of the Mobile Developer Console image stream that will be created by the operator.

|`MDC_IMAGE_STREAM_INITIAL_IMAGE`
|`quay.io/aerogear/mobile-developer-console:latest`
| Initial image for the Mobile Developer Console image stream that will be created by the operator.

|`OAUTH_PROXY_IMAGE_STREAM_NAME`
|`mdc-oauth-proxy-imagestream`
| Name of the OAuth proxy image stream that will be created by the operator.

|`OAUTH_PROXY_IMAGE_STREAM_TAG`
|`latest`
| Tag of the OAuth proxy image stream that will be created by the operator.

|`OAUTH_PROXY_IMAGE_STREAM_INITIAL_IMAGE`
|`docker.io/openshift/oauth-proxy:v1.1.0`
| Initial image for the OAuth proxy image stream that will be created by the operator.

|===

CAUTION: Re-deploying this operator with customized images will cause
_all_ instances owned by the operator to be updated.


=== Container Names

If you would like to modify the container names, you can use the following environment variables.

.Environment Variables
|===
|Name |Default

|`MDC_CONTAINER_NAME`
|`mdc`

|`OAUTH_PROXY_CONTAINER_NAME`
|`mdc-oauth-proxy`

|===


== Custom Resources (aka How to get value from this operator)

=== MobileDeveloperConsole

This is the main installation resource kind. Creation of a valid
MobileDeveloperConsole CR will result in a functional Mobile Developer
Console deployed to your namespace.

Here are all of the configurable fields in a MobileDeveloperConsole:

.MobileDeveloperConsole fields
|===
|Field Name |Description

|oAuthClientId
|Id of the OAuthClient to use when protecting the Mobile Developer Console
 instance with OpenShift OAuth Proxy.

|oAuthClientSecret
|Password of the OAuthClient to use when protecting the Mobile Developer Console
 instance with OpenShift OAuth Proxy.

|===

An example MobileDeveloperConsole resource is available at
`./deploy/crds/mdc_v1alpha1_mobiledeveloperconsole_cr.yaml`:

.mdc_v1alpha1_mobiledeveloperconsole_cr.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: mdc.aerogear.org/v1alpha1
kind: MobileDeveloperConsole
metadata:
  name: example-mdc
spec:
  oAuthClientId: mobile-developer-console
  oAuthClientSecret: foobar
----

To create this, you can run:

....
kubectl apply -n mobile-developer-console -f ./deploy/crds/mdc_v1alpha1_mobiledeveloperconsole_cr.yaml
....

To see the created instance then, you can run:

....
kubectl get mdc example-mdc -n mobile-developer-console -o yaml
....


== Getting help

All AeroGear projects use the same communication channels.

*Issue tracker*

Our main issue tracker is {aerogear_jira}. Issues may also be created
here on GitHub for individual projects.

*Chat*

For synchronous real-time chat, we use Matrix/IRC. These are bridged
together, so you can choose which is more convenient for you:
{aerogear_matrix} or {aerogear_freenode}.

*Discussion list*

For important conversations, we discuss asynchronously on this
{mailing_list}. This is great for discussions that should involve many
people in different time zones, and allows us to easily link back to
conversations in future.

== Development

=== Prerequisites

- Access to an OpenShift cluster with admin privileges to be able to
  create Roles.  {minishift} is suggested.

- Go, Make, dep, operator-sdk, kubectl (kubectl can just be a symlink
  to oc)

=== Running the operator

1. Prepare the operator project:

....
make cluster/prepare
....

2. Run the operator (locally, not in OpenShift):

....
make code/run
....

3. Create a Mobile Developer Console instance (in another terminal):

....
make install-mdc
....

4. Watch the status of your Mobile Developer Console instance provisioning (optional):

....
watch -n1 "kubectl get po -n mobile-developer-console && echo '' && kubectl get mdc -o yaml -n mobile-developer-console"
....

5. If you want to be able to work with resources that require the
local instance of your operator to be able to talk to the MDC instance
in the cluster, then you'll need to make a corresponding domain name
available locally. Something like the following should work, by adding
an entry to /etc/hosts for the example Service that's created, then
forwarding the port from the relevant Pod in the cluster to the local
machine. Run this in a separate terminal, and ctrl+c to clean it up
when finished:

6. When finished, clean up:
....
make cluster/clean
....
